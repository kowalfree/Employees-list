Project was created based on the type of object-oriented programming. Three structures have been separated, each of which has a different task. The first one is used to save the global database in a text file on the computer and to create a dynamic container with the local database. The second structure uses functions from STL on the local data container. The last structure is a container for the basic data of each employee. In order to avoid undesirable errors, validation of data entered by the user was used.
