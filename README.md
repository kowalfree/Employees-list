Employees List

The project is intended to serve as a database in a company employing employees. We can display the entire list (if any exist) of employees or a single employee by providing his or her identification number. For other functions, we can add or remove a new employee from the list or delete the entire list. Additionally, we can generate a text file with a list of registered employees.
